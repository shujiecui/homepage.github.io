<sub> I’m a Lecturer at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/) in the [Faculty of Information Technology](https://www.monash.edu/it). I obtained my PhD degree from [the University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html) in 2019. Before joining Monash University, I was a Post-Doc researcher in the [Large-Scale Data & Systems (LSDS) group](https://lsds.doc.ic.ac.uk/) in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London, UK.  

### My research
<sub>My main research interests include applied cryptography, data protection in various systems, trusted execution environments, side-channel attacks, and privacy-preserving machine learning.
