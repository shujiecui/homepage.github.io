I’m a Lecturer at Monash University in the Faculty of Information Technology. I obtained my PhD degree from the University of Auckland in 2019. Before joining Monash University, I was a Post-Doc researcher in the Large-Scale Data & Systems (LSDS) group in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London, UK. 

## My research
My main research interests include applied cryptography, information security in cloud computing and distributed systems, trusted execution environments, side-channel attacks, and privacy-preserving machine learning.

I am always looking for self-motivated students. Please email me your CV, transcript, research statement, english test score.
